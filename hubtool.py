# pyright: strict
"""hubtool — an independent Claude Code chat as a first-class MAIL HUB client
(FR-06, user-ruled 2026-08-05: the strictly-org-to-org scope is reversed).

Two halves, one file, stdlib only (the externtool.py pattern):

MCP server (what a session adds):
    claude mcp add mailhub -- python <repo>\\hub\\hubtool.py
  Tools: hub_register (first run chooses the NAME — persisted; later calls
  are idempotent), hub_list (roster with kinds + presence), hub_send,
  hub_read, hub_wait (bounded long-poll).

Listener (the chatq-shape delivery half — arm it once with the Monitor tool):
    python hub/hubtool.py listen <name>       (or MAILHUB_NAME=<name>)
  Emits one line per inbound mail (long-polling the hub, acking after print),
  which is exactly how chatq delivers today — making the hub a candidate
  end-to-end chatq replacement. The name selects WHICH session identity
  listens; use the name this session registered with.

Identity (user-ruled 2026-08-05, superseding the per-profile single
identity): EACH SESSION mints its own unique identity, keyed by a NAME the
session chooses itself — semantically appropriate to its own context /
directive / purpose (e.g. "orgtree-redteam", "nebula-builder"). Identities
live one-per-file at ~/.orgtree/hub-clients/<name>.json: the 256-bit uid in
the file is the secret (the hub stores sha256(uid)), and the address is
    <name>.<username>.<sha256(uid)[:6]>        (kind: chat)
The session REMEMBERS its chosen name and registers with it again to resume
the same address — the name is the key, so a different name is a different
identity (which is exactly what makes N concurrent sessions safe: each has
its own address and its own deliver-once mailbox, no racing). Orgs address a
chat as @net:<slug>; the dial-out direction is preserved (the chat polls the
hub; nothing ever reaches in).

Multi-hub (user spec 2026-08-05): one identity may live on SEVERAL hubs at
once. The identity file carries the list (`hubs: [address, …]` — never an
env var: the env is per-process, the point is one session on many hubs), and
the address is the SAME everywhere because the fingerprint derives from the
uid, not from any hub. register joins every listed hub; listen polls them
all concurrently (one merged stream, each line tagged `via <hub>` when more
than one is listed, seen-ring PER HUB — ids are only unique within a hub);
send resolves the hub by roster (several hold the target → the local one
wins, fewest hops; none → refuse naming the hubs searched). Manage the list:
    python hub/hubtool.py addhub <name> <address>
    python hub/hubtool.py drophub <name> <address>

Env: MAILHUB_URL (the BOOTSTRAP hub, default http://127.0.0.1:7370 — used
until the identity carries its own list) · MAILHUB_NAME (pre-seeds /
selects the name; the listener requires one).

# ☞ THE MISSED-MAIL BUG (diagnosed live 2026-08-05, user: "pervasive and

# made the listener's print() RAISE — after take_fresh had already acked
# the message and marked it seen. The catch-all swallowed the error and
# slept: the mail was consumed and never shown, unrecoverably. UTF-8 with
