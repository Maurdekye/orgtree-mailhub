"""FR-06 · independent chats as hub clients — hub/hubtool.py, attacked.

A chat client is a hub participant with no org behind it: its whole identity is
one file in the user's profile, and the uid in that file IS the secret. That
makes three things worth attacking, none of which the org path has to worry
about.

  * THE FILE IS THE IDENTITY. Minting the uid and choosing the name is a
    read-modify-write on a shared path, and the intended usage — several Claude
    Code chats on one machine — is exactly the concurrent case.
  * THE NAME IS IMMUTABLE AND CHOSEN ONCE. Anything that can be written into it
    is permanent, so a value the hub will refuse is a client that can never
    register and cannot fix itself.
  * THERE IS NO DEDUPE. The org client keeps a seen-ring; hubtool acks after
    printing and keeps nothing, so every ack that does not land is a message
    the user reads twice.

    §1  identity — minted once, chosen once, shaped correctly
    §2  two chats registering at the same moment
    §3  the uid is a secret — header only, never a URL, never a result
    §4  listen mode — what a failed ack costs
    §5  kind — who claims it, and whether it can be flipped later
    §6  the pre-kind database migration

Hermetic: the hub runs in-process behind a urlopen shim, so hubtool's REAL
request construction (paths, headers, payloads) is what gets exercised.

    when a chat reads it only goes to `fetched`."

    The hub's ladder has two carriers, not one: `state` (queued → fetched) is
    moved by /api/ack, and `delivered_at` / `read_at` are moved by
    /api/receipts. Orgs drive BOTH — net.py keeps a _dlv_q and a _read_q and
    flushes them — so an org recipient walks ▫ → ✓ → ✓✓ → read. hubtool calls
    /api/ack and NOTHING ELSE, so a chat recipient stops at ✓ forever and the
    sender can never tell "the chat has it" from "the chat has read it".

    That is not a hub asymmetry: /api/receipts authorises on `to_slug IN
    (my slugs)` with no notion of kind, so a chat's receipts would be accepted
    today. The gap is entirely on the client side."""
