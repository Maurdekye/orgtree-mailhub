"""The mail hub (F-06 Phase B) — hub/mailhub/{app,db}.py, adversarially.

The hub is the one component of orgtree that is a NETWORK SERVICE: multi-writer,
reachable by anyone on the closed network, and holding everyone's mail in
plaintext. Its whole security model is two sentences — *joining is open, but
ADDRESSES are owned*, and *the direction of the connection is the boundary* —
so the tests that matter are the ones that attack the address ownership and the
custody rules, not the happy paths.

The sharpest of those is the SUFFIX ATTACK. An org's address ends in the first
6 characters of its fingerprint, and 6 hex characters is a 24-bit space that a
laptop collides in milliseconds (this suite does it in ~3,000 tries, below).
If verification ever compared that visible suffix instead of the full digest,
stealing an address would be seconds of work. §2 builds the collision and
proves the hub refuses it.

    §1  registration — first write wins, ownership, display refresh, slugs
    §2  ☞ the suffix attack, constructed for real
    §3  poll — multiplexing, partial credentials, ordering
    §4  custody — redelivery until ack, and only the recipient may ack
    §5  receipts — monotonic, one-sided, and the pushed lifecycle
    §6  send — idempotency, unknown recipient, truncation, caps
    §7  attachments — ownership, binding, download rights, size, blob paths
    §8  retention — the sweep removes row, metadata AND blob
    §9  the read-only UI and healthz

Hermetic: HUB_DATA points at a throwaway directory (set BEFORE the import, the
module reads it at import time), the app is driven in-process through
httpx.ASGITransport, and no socket is ever bound. ASGITransport does not run
the lifespan, which is deliberate: db.connect() creates the schema on every
call and the sweep is invoked directly, so nothing here depends on a background
task existing.

    # live suites registered their throwaway orgs against the REAL hub at
    # 127.0.0.1:7370, one fresh identity per run). This is the OTHER half:

        org, a reinstalled machine, a retired chat identity, a test fixture.

    # retention; never prunes a row with queued mail in custody). The prune
    # is SAFE because the org side now self-heals on 401 (net.py
    # _clear_registration: a hub that answers 401 clears registered_at, so
    # the register loop re-registers — closing neoja's peers-401-forever
